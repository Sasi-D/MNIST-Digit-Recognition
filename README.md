# MNIST-Dimensionality-Reduction
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques using the MNIST dataset. It applies both customized-PCA and customized-Kernel PCA algorithms implemented from scratch to analyze and visualize the data, reconstruct images, and assess the effectiveness of different kernels for digit classification.


**part i** ->  it is the implementation of pca on mnist data-set and analysing the images of Principle components and as well as variance also.

**part ii**-> reconstructing using different dimensions and picking the right "d" dimension.

**part iii** -> using various kernel functions to implement kernel PCA.
